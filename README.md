How to run:
1) Open folder with solution
2) `docker compose up`
3) Open: http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html

Suggestion for improvement:
1) Algorithm of caching and detecting expired records can be improved
2) Add unit tests
3) More description for the swagger, what can return endpoint, model, status codes, etc.

Already added improvements:
1) Multiple layers of caching
2) Asynchronous optimization
3) Docker to quick and simple depolyment
4) Validation
5) Swagger
